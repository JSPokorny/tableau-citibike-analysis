#### Background ####
Citi-Bikes

Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks to an external site. program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

******Analysis and Findings*******

1 - THe largest start point for the CitiBike is in Central Park.  This is likely because Central Park is regarded as the largest outdoor recreational area in NYC.  It makes sense for CitiBike to make this the largest starting point.

2 - THe largest end stations appear to be near the piers, tunnels, bridges, and transportation hubs (such as subways, train stations, and ferry's).  This might indicate people more interested in renting the bikes as an alternate method of travel compared to walking or taking a car.

3 - The highest trip duration is among 28 year olds.  THe lowest is 102 years old!  Surprisingly, we also see people as old as 81 years old spending an average of 25.27 minutes per trip.  Not many people between 30 and 69 years old spend much time on the bikes.

4 - There were 4.6B males who rented bikes, compared to 1.2B females who rented bikes.

5 - Females biked an average of 2.82 more minutes per trip then men.  This may indicate men biked faster or females enjoyed riding slightly longer than men.
